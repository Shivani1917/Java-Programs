        Object oriented programming is all about creating objects that contains datas 
        and methods..

        CLASSES:Template for objects[container for objects];
        OBJECTS:Individuals of a class inheriting all variables and methods from the class.
                Physically existing varianles[user defined];
            ex-in real world car is an object; 
               attributes-color,weight;
               methods-drive,break;
            Syntax::classname newObj(object name) =new classname();

        class attributes are variables within a class..[fields]
        for accessing class attributes //object.attribute
        overriding : changing existing value with another value
               to overcome overriding use "final keyword" which is a modifier before the attribute..
